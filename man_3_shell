# SIMPLE SHELL MANUAL PAGE

## NAME
                    hsh - Simple shell

DESCRIPTION
	hsh is a simple shell that reads user input and executes commands.
       It supports basic internal commands like 'cd', 'ls', 'exit', and external
       commands found in the system `PATH`. It can be run in both interactive
       and non-interactive modes.

       The shell reads a command, forks a process to run it, and then waits
       for the process to finish.

## INTERN COMMANDS
	cd [directory]
           Changes the current directory. If no directory is specified,
           it changes to the user's home directory.

## UTIL FUNCTIONS
       - display_shell: Displays a prompt for the user to enter a command. It typically represents the interactive shell.
       - execute_command: Executes a command by searching for its path in PATH, then launches a child process using execve. It also handles special commands like exit and env.
       - read_line: Reads a line of input entered by the user, usually using fgets or getline to capture standard input.
       - tokenize_command: Splits a command line into tokens (arguments) separated by spaces or special characters, typically using strtok, to prepare for execution.
       - execute_fork: Creates a child process using fork to execute a command. The child process uses execve to run the command, while the parent process waits for the child to finish.
       - main: The main function of the program, typically responsible for initialization, displaying the prompt, managing the command input loop, and executing commands until exit.

## COMPILATION
       gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

## ERRORS
	If a command fails, the shell shows an error message:
           $ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
           ./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found

## FILES
       /etc/passwd
           User information used by `cd`.

       /etc/environment
           Environment variables for the shell.

## EXAMPLES
	 Example: Change directory
        
           hsh> cd /home/user
           hsh> pwd
           /home/user

       Example: Run a command

           hsh> ls
           (lists files in the current directory)
